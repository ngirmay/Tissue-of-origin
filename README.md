Gene Expression Analysis Across Cancer Types
This report presents a series of visualizations that represent the analysis of gene expression data across various cancer types. The visualizations are intended to convey patterns, distributions, and relationships within the data, and to suggest possible future directions for this tissue of origin project.

Heatmap of Log2 Transformed Gene Expression by Cancer Type
The heatmap illustrates the log2 transformed expression levels of genes across different cancer types. Each row represents a gene, and each column represents a cancer type, with color intensity indicating the expression level. The transformation helps to normalize the data and makes it easier to observe differences across the cancer types.

Main Takeaways:
Expression Patterns: Some genes show higher expression in certain cancer types, which could be indicative of cancer-specific biological processes or pathways.
Potential Biomarkers: Genes with distinct expression profiles across cancer types may serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis or targets for therapy.

Correlation Matrix of Gene Expression Across Cancer Types
The correlation matrix provides a pairwise comparison of gene expression levels across cancer types, revealing how similar the expression profiles are between pairs of cancer types.

Main Takeaways:
Related Cancer Types: A strong positive correlation suggests that certain cancer types have similar gene expression profiles, which might indicate shared underlying mechanisms or common origins.
Diverse Expression: Conversely, cancer types with lower correlations might have unique expression profiles, suggesting different mechanisms or subtypes.

Classification Report Visualization
The bar plots display precision, recall, and F1-scores for the SVC model that predicts cancer types from gene expression data. Each bar represents a score for a particular cancer type.

Main Takeaways:
Model Performance: High scores across most cancer types indicate good model performance. However, certain types such as READ show lower scores, suggesting room for improvement depending on cancer type. 
Balanced Metrics: The F1-score combines precision and recall, providing a balanced view of the model's performance.
Future Directions:
Deeper Analysis: Further investigation is needed into genes or cancer types with unique expression patterns to understand the biological significance.
Model Refinement: For cancer types with lower classification scores, additional features or alternative modeling techniques could be explored to improve performance.
Pathway Analysis: Integrating pathway information could give insights into the biological processes driving the observed expression patterns.
