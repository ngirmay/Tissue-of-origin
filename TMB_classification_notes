Abstract
TMB - predictor of response to immunotherapy 
Tumor only variant calling (no matched normal) - inflated TMB estimates 
TabNet - XGBoost and LightGMB (best one) for somatic v. germline classification 
Tabular data 
Supervised classification
TCGA dataset 
R2 - ?
Generalize across cancer types and capture kits (100% call rate)
TMB estimates for black patients are extremely inflated relative to white patients due to racial bias of germline databases 
XGBoost and LightGBM eliminates significant racial bias 
Introduction
Somatic mutation count can predict response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI)
“Tumor mutation burden (TMB)—defined as the number of coding nonsynonymous somatic mutations per megabase of DNA, and often measured through whole-exome sequencing (WES)—is a strong predictor of therapeutic response and survival in solid tumors” 
Phase 2 KEYNOTE-158 trial - FDA approved TMB as marker across all tumor subtypes for anti-PD1 ICI
Gain of function mutations - oncogenes 
Loss of function mutations - tumor suppressors 
VAF - variant allele fraction
Lack of matched normal increases false positive rate 
Some computational methods developed to improve tumor-only variant calling (pureCN and SGZ) - Bayesian methods that infer the altered genomic state of the tumor to estimate somatic and germline probabilities in samples without matched normal 
Global properties of cancer genome - purity and ploidy - DNA copy number also measured - used along with VAF to calculate the posterior probability a mutation is somatic - coupled with complex statistics of NGS 
Tree-based ML methods with gradient boosting 
Results 
Train/test 
Somatic mutation calling pipeline 
TMB, CNV, and some composition (tumor purity) can impact mutation calling 
Multiple cancer sample types - model trained this way 
Model 
30 mutation and copy number specific features using tumor only samples
COSMIC database 
Major allele frequency 
Trinucleotide context and base substitution type characterized (basis for mutational signature) 
Heterozygous germline SNPS of similar copy number are identified 
XGboost - a gradient boosting tree-based algorithm (Light GBM is similar) 
TabNet leverages neural attention modules (feature masks)
Saliency of features and each instance 
Training set construction 
105 tumor samples in sever cancer subtypes from TCGA 
Somatic and germline truth labels generated using results from variant calling pipeline that included patient-matched normal samples 
Features for tabular ML classifiers engineered using variant and CNV calls from independent tumor-only pipeline
Sequenced at Broad Institute using Agilent custom v2 exome-capture kit
Validation set construction 
45 tumor subtypes absent from training data 
WES kit shown to exhibit district genomic coverage compared to V2 Agilent kit used in training 
Avoided overfitting?
